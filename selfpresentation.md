### **Self-Presentation**  

Hello, everyone. My name is Azer Agazade, and I am a Java developer with over two years of experience in software development.

I have always been passionate about solving complex problems, puzzles, and logic games like chess. Programming, in many ways, feels like an extension of these interests—it challenges me to think critically, break down complex tasks into manageable parts, and find optimal solutions. That’s why I was naturally drawn to IT, as it provides endless opportunities to create, innovate, and continuously improve.

I chose Java as my primary programming language because of its versatility, reliability, and strong ecosystem. Java allows me to build scalable applications, whether it's a monolithic system or a microservices architecture. It is widely used in enterprise solutions, fintech, and large-scale backend systems, making it a solid choice for long-term career growth. The strong community support, extensive libraries, and frameworks like Spring Boot further reinforced my decision to specialize in Java.

My primary technology stack includes Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, and AWS services. Additionally, I have experience working with Docker, Liquibase, OpenFeign, MapStruct, Lombok, and Testcontainers. Throughout my career, I have been focused on developing efficient, scalable, and well-structured applications while adhering to best coding practices.

#### **Projects I Have Worked On**  

One of the key projects I worked on was a **Hotel Management System**, a **monolithic application** designed to automate hotel room reservations, customer management, and financial transactions. The system allowed users to book rooms, manage reservations, and process payments efficiently. The backend was built using **Spring Boot**, and we utilized **PostgreSQL** for data storage. The application supported integration with third-party services for payment processing and email notifications. We documented our API using **Swagger (Springdoc OpenAPI)** to facilitate communication between frontend and backend developers.

Another major project was a **Task Management System**, also a **monolithic application**. This system was designed to help teams track and manage their tasks, set priorities, and monitor deadlines. It featured a role-based access system and a well-structured API to interact with multiple clients. We used **Spring Boot, Liquibase for database migrations, OpenFeign for inter-service communication, and Swagger for API documentation**.

The latest project I participated in was **EasyFin**, a **microservices-based** digital-first neobank that provides online banking services across the European Union. The goal was to create a secure, user-friendly mobile banking platform available on both **Android and iOS**. The backend was built using **Java (Spring Boot) and GoLang**, with **AWS services such as Cognito, SES, and S3** for authentication and cloud storage. The project followed a microservices architecture, and we implemented inter-service communication using **Spring Cloud OpenFeign**. We used **Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring** and **Caffeine for caching** to improve performance. The database layer was managed using **PostgreSQL with Liquibase** for schema migrations. The API was documented using **Swagger**, making it easier for frontend developers to consume the services.

#### **My Role and Responsibilities**  

On the **EasyFin** project, I was responsible for:  
- Developing **backend microservices** using **Spring Boot, Java, and OpenFeign**  
- Implementing **RESTful APIs**, documented with **Swagger (Springdoc OpenAPI)**  
- Integrating AWS services such as **Cognito for authentication**, **SES for email notifications**, and **S3 for file storage**  
- Managing database operations using **PostgreSQL and Liquibase**  
- Optimizing performance using **Caffeine caching**  
- Writing unit and integration tests using **JUnit, Testcontainers, and Awaitility**  
- Participating in **code reviews**, ensuring high-quality and maintainable code  

#### **Team and Workflow**  

I worked in a **distributed team** consisting of **18 members**:  
- **4 Java developers**, **3 Go developers**, **3 Android developers**, **2 iOS developers**, **1 QA engineer**, **1 UI/UX designer**, **1 business/system analyst**, and **1 project manager**.  
- The team was spread across different locations, so we relied heavily on remote collaboration tool like **Jira**.  

We followed the **Scrum methodology**, working in **two-week sprints**. Our workflow included:  
- **Daily stand-up meetings** to synchronize work  
- **Sprint planning** to define goals and scope for each iteration  
- **Code reviews** – first through **peer reviews among trainees**, then through **technical lead validation**  
- **Sprint demos and retrospectives** to ensure continuous improvement  

#### **My Strengths**  

I consider my main professional strengths to be:  
- **Strong problem-solving skills** – I always focus on finding **efficient** and **scalable** solutions to complex issues.  
- **Attention to clean code and best practices** – I adhere to SOLID principles, write maintainable code, and ensure proper documentation.  
- **Adaptability and willingness to learn** – I continuously update my skills and keep up with the latest trends in Java development.  
- **Teamwork and communication** – I actively participate in discussions, share knowledge, and contribute to team success.  

#### **Conclusion**  

That’s all about me for now. Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
